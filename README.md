Gacha life unity is a project i've had in mind for a while. Its very self explanitory. Its gacha life... made in unity. The reason I made this, is so instead of going through loads of some sort of source code if you can find any, you can download a unity project and edit a simple version, instead of whatever lunime used for that.

idk just do whatever you want with it.
