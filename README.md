Gacha Life Unity  is a project I started back around the start of 2022, in an attempt to recreate Gacha Life (and the newer games) in the Unity game engine.
The main idea was for modding, and adding extra QOL features not present in the original games, while being in a nicer engine, instead of the official games' Shockwave Flash and Adobe Air engine.

# Unity Project Usage

You can clone the project and do whatever you'd like with it, but please don't take the project and mark it as your own. Removing my credits in the game is fine, just don't replace it with your own.

# Why was there such a huge pause in development?
I'm not very consistent with working on this project (like, I'll work on it for a few weeks non-stop, then just have a huge break from working on it), which resulted in this not really getting any updates for around 2 years. In the time I *WAS* occasionally working on Gacha Club Unity, but I thought I should finish the first game first. Plus, I need to completely rewrite and remake Gacha Club Unity anyways
