Gacha Life Unity  is a project I started back around the start of 2022, in an attempt to recreate Gacha Life (and the newer games) in the Unity game engine.
The main idea was for modding, and adding extra QOL features not present in the original games, while being in a nicer engine, instead of the official games' Shockwave Flash and Adobe Air engine.

# Unity Project Usage

You can clone the project and do whatever you'd like with it, but please don't take the project and mark it as your own. Removing my credits in the game is fine, just don't replace it with your own.

# Why was there such a huge pause in development?

I had 0 updates on this entire project for around 2 years. I mostly stopped working on it, as I had been very on and off about being in the Gacha community as a whole, and when I did work on this project, it was work on Gacha Club Unity, as it's the more advanced and popular game. I recently started working again on this, however, and am still actively making progress. Gacha Club Unity is currently a privated project, and doesn't really have much anyways. once Gacha Life Unity is fully released, the Gacha Club Unity project will be remade and will be put open source.
