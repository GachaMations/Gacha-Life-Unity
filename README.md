Gacha Life Unity  is a project I started back around the start of 2022, in an attempt to recreate Gacha Life (and the newer games) in the Unity game engine.
The main idea was for modding, and adding extra QOL features not present in the original games, while being in a nicer engine, instead of the official games' Shockwave Flash and Adobe Air engine.

# Unity Project Usage

You can clone the project and do whatever you'd like with it, but please don't take the project and mark it as your own. Removing my credits in the game is fine, just don't replace it with your own.

# Current Plans

As of right now, I mainly plan on simply finishing the Unity recreation of Gacha Life, and moving onto custom features later. That being said, If there is a feature that requires some service I can't access (like lunime server access), or I want to take a break from recreation and want to start on one of the planned features, I may start that before the game is finished.

Currently planned features:

[x] Data transfer over wifi (complete)<br>
[] Support for all devices (Windows, Mac, Linux, Mobile, etc)<br>
[] Mod Support (2 types: Asset modding and Code modding)<br>
[] New skits system (Have it as a full frame-by-frame video maker, with exporting video out)<br>
[] Allow importing and exporting of a lot more data (individual studio scenes, characters, skits, etc)<br>

And probably more i've forgotten.<br><br>

# Why was there such a huge pause in development?
I'm not very consistent with working on this project (like, I'll work on it for a few weeks non-stop, then just have a huge break from working on it), which resulted in this not really getting any updates for around 2 years. In the time I *WAS* occasionally working on Gacha Club Unity, but I thought I should finish the first game first. Plus, I need to completely rewrite and remake Gacha Club Unity anyways

# Contributing
This project is COMPLETELY open source. All the code currently seen in the repository is 1:1 with the code used to build the official release. I currently do not use any keys for external software, but if I eventually end up needing any, a guide for getting a key and adding it to he project will be provided.
If you would like to view this game in the editor, the current unity version is 2021.3.5f1. If you have not used unity before, you simply have to download Unity Hub from unity's website, then in the archive, download the version listed above. You can then clone this repository, and open it in unity.

Contribution of any kind is highly appriciated. If you have coding knowledge, then fixing bugs, rewriting bad code, resolving bugs, or even just making mods is one way to SERIOUSLY help the project, but even if you don't, submitting bugs or feature requests / improvements on the [issues](https://github.com/GachaMations/Gacha-Life-Unity/issues) page will greatly help too.
